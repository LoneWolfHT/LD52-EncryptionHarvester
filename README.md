# Encryption Harvester

### Post-Jam Changes:
- Reduced the volume of the text typing effects
- Ingame Music: Added instruments cut from the jam version, track is 2x as long
- Fixed yellow letter hints showing for letters you've already found
- Toggling on the post-jam button will also enable extra hints
- Made the help text below the hacking terminal more noticable
- Added help text saying your progress is saved if you exit to the menu
- Added letter count to the text showing the current word
- Made the guess command change its color while typing if you don't have the right amount of letters
- When you make a guess the terminal will automatically write 'guess ' for your next command
- Added text to tell you when you're guessing two words merged together (like "PACIFICOCEAN" instead of "PACIFIC OCEAN")
- Fixed highscore mode being pretty much impossible play. It might as well not be in the jam version.
- Clear terminal whenever you move to a new set of words
